This generation process usually requires the identification of the disentangled latent representations, such as content and style, that underlie the observed data. However, it becomes more challenging when faced with a scarcity of paired data and labeling information. Existing disentangled methods crucially rely on oversimplified assumptions, such as assuming independent content and style variables, to identify the latent variables, even though such assumptions may not hold for complex data distributions. For instance, food reviews tend to involve words like tasty, whereas movie reviews commonly contain words such as thrilling for the same positive sentiment. This problem is exacerbated when data are sampled from multiple domains since the dependence between content and style may vary significantly over domains. In this work, we tackle the domain-varying dependence between the content and the style variables inherent in the counterfactual generation task. We provide identification guarantees for such latent-variable models by leveraging the relative sparsity of the influences from different latent variables. Our theoretical insights enable the development of a doMain AdapTive counTerfactual gEneration model, called (MATTE). Our theoretically grounded framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised style transfer tasks, where neither paired data nor style labels are utilized, across four large-scale datasets.

Different scenarios hold distinct and unique characteristics, calling for domain-specific investigations and corresponding designed recommender systems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on food delivery recommendations to unveil unique features in this domain, where users order food online and enjoy their meals shortly after delivery. We first conduct an in-depth analysis on food delivery datasets. The analysis shows that repeat orders are prevalent for both users and stores, and situations' differently influence repeat and exploration consumption in the food delivery recommender systems. Moreover, we revisit the ability of existing situation-aware methods for repeat and exploration recommendations respectively, and find them unable to effectively solve both tasks simultaneously. Based on the analysis and experiments, we have designed two separate recommendation models -- ReRec for repeat orders and ExpRec for exploration orders; both are simple in their design and computation. We conduct experiments on three real-world food delivery datasets, and our proposed models outperform various types of baselines on repeat, exploration, and combined recommendation tasks. This paper emphasizes the importance of dedicated analyses and methods for domain-specific characteristics for the recommender system studies.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 10:39:03 UTC (598 KB)"

However, little is known about the sociotechnical landscape of these ``indie'' platforms. In this paper, we analyzed these platforms to understand why they were created, how they operate, and what technologies they use. We collected data on 495 indie platforms and detailed survey responses from 29 platforms. We found that personalized, timely service is a central value of indie platforms, as is a sense of responsibility to the local community they serve. Indie platforms are motivated to provide fair rates for restaurants and couriers. These alternative business practices differentiate them from mainstream platforms. Though indie platforms have plans to expand, a lack of customizability in off-the-shelf software prevents independent platforms from personalizing services for their local communities. We show that these platforms are a widespread and longstanding fixture of the food delivery market. We illustrate the diversity of motivations and values to explain why a one-size-fits-all support is insufficient, and we discuss the siloing of technology that inhibits platforms' growth. Through these insights, we aim to promote future HCI research into the potential development of public-interest technologies for local food delivery.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 22:44:46 UTC (4,585 KB)"

This type of drying is commonly encountered in manufacturing processes such as spray drying and spray pyrolysis, which have applications in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals. The proposed model consists of three stages. In the first stage, we consider the evaporation of the liquid in the presence of solid particles. The second stage involves the formation of a porous crust around a wet core region, with liquid evaporation occurring through the crust layer. Finally, the third stage involves sensible heating of the dry particle to reach ambient temperature. To solve the physical models governing these processes, we use a finite difference method with a moving grid methodology. This allows us to account for the moving interface between the crust and the wet core region of the droplet. In this study, we use a non-uniform temperature model that takes into account the spatial variation of temperature inside the droplet. We also assess the validity of a uniform temperature model. To validate our model, we compare it with experimental data on the drying of a single droplet containing colloidal silica particles. We find that our model agrees well with the experimental results. We rigorously examine assumptions made in the model, such as the shape of the solid particles and the continuum flow of vapor through the porous crust. In addition, we analyze the effects of drying conditions, such as the velocity, temperature, relative humidity, and concentration of solid particles, on the drying rate and the final morphology of the particle. Finally, we develop a regime map that can be used to determine whether the final particle will be solid or hollow, based on the operating conditions.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 02:44:08 UTC (21,381 KB)"

The large number of infected people and the different mortality rates between countries has given rise to many hypotheses about the key points that make the virus so lethal in some places. In this study, the eating habits of 170 countries were evaluated in order to find correlations between these habits and mortality rates caused by COVID-19 using machine learning techniques that group the countries together according to the different distribution of fat, energy, and protein across 23 different types of food, as well as the amount ingested in kilograms. Results shown how obesity and the high consumption of fats appear in countries with the highest death rates, whereas countries with a lower rate have a higher level of cereal consumption accompanied by a lower total average intake of kilocalories.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 21:32:56 UTC (1,281 KB)"

This expansion is largely concentrated in so-called frontiers, defined here as places experiencing marked transformations due to rapid resource exploitation. Understanding the mechanisms shaping these frontiers is crucial for sustainability. Previous work focused mainly on explaining how active frontiers advance, in particular into tropical forests. Comparatively, our understanding of how frontiers emerge in territories considered marginal in terms of agricultural productivity and global market integration remains weak. We synthesize conceptual tools explaining resource and land-use frontiers, including theories of land rent and agglomeration economies, of frontiers as successive waves, spaces of territorialization, friction, and opportunities, anticipation and expectation. We then propose a new theory of frontier emergence, which identifies exogenous pushes, legacies of past waves, and actors anticipations as key mechanisms by which frontiers emerge. Processes of abnormal rent creation and capture and the built-up of agglomeration economies then constitute key mechanisms sustaining active frontiers. Finally, we discuss five implications for the governance of frontiers for sustainability. Our theory focuses on agriculture and deforestation frontiers in the tropics, but can be inspirational for other frontier processes including for extractive resources, such as minerals.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 19:50:29 UTC (565 KB)"

Oliveira","General Economics (econ.GN)","The exploration of existing commercial opportunities has been increasing the share of commercial (non-aeronautical) revenues in the total revenues of airports worldwide. These revenues, also called commercial, non-aeronautical, or non-tariff revenues, come from rentals, duty-free shops, food and beverage sales, parking, advertising, etc. In other words, everything that is not the main business of the airport. Consequently, the dependence on commercial revenues has also become increasingly important, and airport managers are interested in understanding how to improve their financial results with this new revenue source, as it not only improves financial outcomes but also optimizes passengers' time and money consumption options at airports. Therefore, this chapter seeks to discuss the main determinants of commercial revenues at national airports, analyzing the possible impacts of the behavior of passengers from low-cost carriers (LCC) on these revenues, combined with other determining factors.","Sat, 17 Feb 2024 20:22:17 UTC (479 KB)"

However, concerns about the impact of pesticides on biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health, especially for populations residing close to cultivated areas, are growing. This study investigates how exposure and possible risks to residents can be estimated at high spatial granularity based on plant protection product data. The complexities of such analysis were explored in France, where relevant data with good granularity are publicly available. Integrating sets of spatial datasets and exposure assessment methodologies, we have developed an indicator to monitor the levels of pesticide risk faced by residents. By spatialising pesticide sales data according to their authorization on specific crops, we developed a detailed map depicting potential pesticide loads at parcel level across France. This spatial distribution served as the basis for an exposure and risk assessment, modelled following the European Food Safety Authority's guidelines. Combining the risk map with population distribution data, we have developed an indicator that allows to monitor patterns in non-dietary exposure to pesticides. Our results show that in France, on average, 13% of people might be exposed to pesticides due to living in the proximity to treated crops. This exposure is in the lower range for 34%, moderate range for 40% and higher range for 25% of the exposed population. The risk evaluation is based on worst case assumptions and values should not be taken as a regulatory risk assessment but as indicator to use, for example, for monitoring time trends. The purpose of this indicator is to demonstrate that more granular pesticide data can improve risk reduction strategies. Harmonized and high-resolution data can help in identifying regions where to focus on sustainable farming.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 12:05:21 UTC (29,118 KB)"

This paper presents the Cloud Kitchen platform as a decision-making tool for restaurants with food delivery and a simulator to evaluate the impact of the decisions. The platform consists of a Technology-Specific Bridge (TSB) that provides an interface for communicating with restaurants or the simulator. TSB uses a PDDL model to represent decisions embedded in the Unified Planning Framework (UPF). Decision-making, which concerns allocating customers' orders to vehicles and deciding in which order the customers will be served (for each vehicle), is done via a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), an efficient tool for this problem. We show that decisions made by our platform can improve customer satisfaction by reducing the number of delayed deliveries using a real-world historical dataset.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 14:31:33 UTC (1,535 KB)"

Through meticulous monitoring of intrinsic environmental parameters within the greenhouse and the integration of machine learning algorithms, the conditions within the greenhouse are aptly modulated. The envisaged outcome is an enhancement in crop growth efficiency and yield, accompanied by a reduction in resource wastage. In the backdrop of escalating global population figures and the escalating exigencies of climate change, agriculture confronts unprecedented challenges. Conventional agricultural paradigms have proven inadequate in addressing the imperatives of food safety and production efficiency. Against this backdrop, greenhouse agriculture emerges as a viable solution, proffering a controlled milieu for crop cultivation to augment yields, refine quality, and diminish reliance on natural resources [b1]. Nevertheless, greenhouse agriculture contends with a gamut of challenges. Traditional greenhouse management strategies, often grounded in experiential knowledge and predefined rules, lack targeted personalized regulation, thereby resulting in resource inefficiencies. The exigencies of real-time monitoring and precise control of the greenhouse's internal environment gain paramount importance with the burgeoning scale of agriculture. To redress this challenge, the study introduces IoT technology and machine learning algorithms into greenhouse agriculture, aspiring to institute an intelligent agricultural greenhouse control system conducive to augmenting the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 09:07:00 UTC (878 KB)"

As a fundamental task in food computing, food detection needs Zero-Shot Detection (ZSD) on novel unseen food objects to support real-world scenarios, such as intelligent kitchens and smart restaurants. Therefore, we first benchmark the task of Zero-Shot Food Detection (ZSFD) by introducing FOWA dataset with rich attribute annotations. Unlike ZSD, fine-grained problems in ZSFD like inter-class similarity make synthesized features inseparable. The complexity of food semantic attributes further makes it more difficult for current ZSD methods to distinguish various food categories. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework ZSFDet to tackle fine-grained problems by exploiting the interaction between complex attributes. Specifically, we model the correlation between food categories and attributes in ZSFDet by multi-source graphs to provide prior knowledge for distinguishing fine-grained features. Within ZSFDet, Knowledge-Enhanced Feature Synthesizer (KEFS) learns knowledge representation from multiple sources (e.g., ingredients correlation from knowledge graph) via the multi-source graph fusion. Conditioned on the fusion of semantic knowledge representation, the region feature diffusion model in KEFS can generate fine-grained features for training the effective zero-shot detector. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method ZSFDet on FOWA and the widely-used food dataset UECFOOD-256, with significant improvements by 1.8% and 3.7% ZSD mAP compared with the strong baseline RRFS. Further experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO prove that enhancement of the semantic knowledge can also improve the performance on general ZSD.

The standard treatment is to supplement carbohydrate intake with an artificial pancreas, i.e. a continuous insulin pump (basal shots), as well as occasional insulin injections (bolus shots). The goal of the treatment is to keep blood glucose at the center of an acceptable range, as measured through a continuous glucose meter. A secondary goal is to minimize injections, which are unpleasant and difficult for some patients to implement. In this study, neuroevolution was used to discover an optimal strategy for the treatment. Based on a dataset of 30 days of treatment and measurements of a single patient, a random forest was first trained to predict future glucose levels. A neural network was then evolved to prescribe carbohydrates, basal pumping levels, and bolus injections. Evolution discovered a Pareto front that reduced deviation from the target and number of injections compared to the original data, thus improving patients' quality of life. To make the system easier to adopt, a language interface was developed with a large language model. Thus, these technologies not only improve patient care but also adoption in a broader population.","Sat, 10 Feb 2024 00:49:46 UTC (1,214 KB)"

This study takes the first step in exposing VLMs' susceptibility to data poisoning attacks that can manipulate responses to innocuous, everyday prompts. We introduce Shadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack method where poison samples are visually indistinguishable from benign images with matching texts. Shadowcast demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is Label Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is Persuasion Attack, which leverages VLMs' text generation capabilities to craft narratives, such as portraying junk food as health food, through persuasive and seemingly rational descriptions. We show that Shadowcast are highly effective in achieving attacker's intentions using as few as 50 poison samples. Moreover, these poison samples remain effective across various prompts and are transferable across different VLM architectures in the black-box setting. This work reveals how poisoned VLMs can generate convincing yet deceptive misinformation and underscores the importance of data quality for responsible deployments of VLMs. Our code is available at: this https URL.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 18:55:53 UTC (15,231 KB)"

C","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Feature selection is a key step when dealing with high dimensional data. In particular, these techniques simplify the process of knowledge discovery from the data by selecting the most relevant features out of the noisy, redundant and irrelevant features. A problem that arises in many of these practical applications is that the outcome of the feature selection algorithm is not stable. Thus, small variations in the data may yield very different feature rankings. Assessing the stability of these methods becomes an important issue in the previously mentioned situations. We propose an information theoretic approach based on the Jensen Shannon divergence to quantify this robustness. Unlike other stability measures, this metric is suitable for different algorithm outcomes: full ranked lists, feature subsets as well as the lesser studied partial ranked lists. This generalized metric quantifies the difference among a whole set of lists with the same size, following a probabilistic approach and being able to give more importance to the disagreements that appear at the top of the list. Moreover, it possesses desirable properties including correction for change, upper lower bounds and conditions for a deterministic selection. We illustrate the use of this stability metric with data generated in a fully controlled way and compare it with popular metrics including the Spearmans rank correlation and the Kunchevas index on feature ranking and selection outcomes, respectively. Additionally, experimental validation of the proposed approach is carried out on a real-world problem of food quality assessment showing its potential to quantify stability from different perspectives.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 22:17:37 UTC (3,864 KB)"

However, modeling animal behavior in complex environments has been challenging. To study how environments shape and constrain visual processing, we developed a deep reinforcement learning framework in which an agent moves through a 3-d environment that it perceives through a vision model, where its only goal is to survive. Within this framework we developed a foraging task where the agent must gather food that sustains it, and avoid food that harms it. We first established that the complexity of the vision model required for survival on this task scaled with the variety and visual complexity of the food in the environment. Moreover, we showed that a recurrent network architecture was necessary to fully exploit complex vision models on the most visually demanding tasks. Finally, we showed how different network architectures learned distinct representations of the environment and task, and lead the agent to exhibit distinct behavioural strategies. In summary, this paper lays the foundation for a computational approach to visual ecology, provides extensive benchmarks for future work, and demonstrates how representations and behaviour emerge from an agent's drive for survival.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 21:23:47 UTC (2,213 KB)"

We accommodate scenarios where the asymptotic distributions of both the first- and second-stage estimators are non-normal. We also allow for the second-stage estimator to exhibit a significant bias due to the first-stage sampling error. We introduce a debiased plug-in estimator and establish its limiting distribution. Our method is readily implementable with complex models. Unlike resampling methods, we eliminate the need for multiple computations of the plug-in estimator. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the effectiveness of our approach in finite samples. We present an empirical application with peer effects on adolescent fast-food consumption habits, where we employ the proposed method to address the issue of biased instrumental variable estimates resulting from the presence of many weak instruments.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 16:59:00 UTC (4,485 KB)"

Methods: 235 students from 5 different educational centres participate in this study between March and December 2015. Data analysis carried out is divided into two blocks: social network analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques. As for the social network analysis, the Girvan-Newman technique was applied to find the best number of cohesive groups within each of the friendship networks of the different classes analysed. Results: After applying Girvan-Newman in the three classes, the best division into clusters was respectively 2 for classroom A, 7 for classroom B and 6 for classroom C. There are significant differences between the groups and the gender and diet variables. After applying K-means using population diet as an input variable, a K-means clustering of 2 clusters for class A, 3 clusters for class B and 3 clusters for class C is obtained. Conclusion: Adolescents form subgroups within their classrooms. Subgroup cohesion is defined by the fact that nodes share similarities in aspects that influence obesity, they share attributes related to food quality and gender. The concept of homophily, related to SNA, justifies our results. Artificial intelligence techniques together with the application of the Girvan-Newman provide robustness to the structural analysis of similarities and cohesion between subgroups.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 09:19:56 UTC (859 KB)"

In an e-commerce setting, user behavior follows a defined sequential chain, including impression, click, and conversion. Marketing strategies exert varied uplift effects at each stage within this chain, impacting metrics like click-through and conversion rate. Despite its utility, existing research has neglected to consider the inter-task across all stages impacts within a specific treatment and has insufficiently utilized the treatment information, potentially introducing substantial bias into subsequent marketing decisions. We identify these two issues as the chain-bias problem and the treatment-unadaptive problem. This paper introduces the Entire Chain UPlift method with context-enhanced learning (ECUP), devised to tackle these issues. ECUP consists of two primary components: 1) the Entire Chain-Enhanced Network, which utilizes user behavior patterns to estimate ITE throughout the entire chain space, models the various impacts of treatments on each task, and integrates task prior information to enhance context awareness across all stages, capturing the impact of treatment on different tasks, and 2) the Treatment-Enhanced Network, which facilitates fine-grained treatment modeling through bit-level feature interactions, thereby enabling adaptive feature adjustment. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets validate ECUPs effectiveness. Moreover, ECUP has been deployed on the Meituan food delivery platform, serving millions of daily active users, with the related dataset released for future research.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 03:30:25 UTC (3,149 KB)"

Therefore, it is necessary to detect diseases quickly and precisely so that disease control can be carried out effectively and efficiently. Classification of potato leaf disease can be done directly. Still, the symptoms cannot always explain the type of disease that attacks potato leaves because there are many types of diseases with symptoms that look the same. Humans also have deficiencies in determining the results of identification of potato leaf disease, so sometimes the results of identification between individuals can be different. Therefore, the use of Deep Learning for the classification process of potato leaf disease is expected to shorten the time and have a high classification accuracy. This study uses a deep learning method with the DenseNet201 architecture. The choice to use the DenseNet201 algorithm in this study is because the model can identify important features of potato leaves and recognize early signs of emerging diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the transfer learning method with the DenseNet201 architecture in increasing the classification accuracy of potato leaf disease compared to traditional classification methods. This study uses two types of scenarios, namely, comparing the number of dropouts and comparing the three optimizers. This test produces the best model using dropout 0.1 and Adam optimizer with an accuracy of 99.5% for training, 95.2% for validation, and 96% for the confusion matrix. In this study, using data testing, as many as 40 images were tested into the model that has been built. The test results on this model resulted in a new accuracy for classifying potato leaf disease, namely 92.5%.","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 03:58:40 UTC (304 KB)"

Hippocampal place cells, known for their role in spatial mapping, exhibit multi-modal responses to sensory cues. The research focuses on understanding how these cells adapt their specialization in response to novel stimuli, specifically examining non-spatial determinants such as odors and social interactions. Using a social-driven food odor recognition model in mice, the study records CA1 hippocampal neuron activity through miniscope imaging. The experimental design involves demonstrations of novel odors to mice, followed by observation sessions with food options. The analysis employs deep neural network tools for behavior tracking and the custom-developed INTENS software package for identifying neural specializations. Results indicate multiple specializations, particularly those related to odor, with differences observed between training and testing sessions. The findings suggest a temporal aspect to the formation of these specializations in novel conditions, necessitating further investigation for precise tracking.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 06:58:58 UTC (623 KB)"

In the rapidly advancing field of agricultural robotics, the necessity of training robots in a virtual environment has become essential. Generating training data to automatize the underlying computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, object detection and classification, also heavily relies on such virtual environments as synthetic data is often required to overcome the shortage and lack of variety of real data sets. However, physics engines commonly employed within the robotics community, such as ODE, Simbody, Bullet, and DART, primarily support motion and collision interaction of rigid bodies. This inherent limitation hinders experimentation and progress in handling non-rigid objects such as plants and crops. In this contribution, we present a plugin for the Gazebo simulation platform based on Cosserat rods to model plant motion. It enables the simulation of plants and their interaction with the environment. We demonstrate that, using our plugin, users can conduct harvesting simulations in Gazebo by simulating a robotic arm picking fruits and achieve results comparable to real-world experiments.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 17:19:46 UTC (10,621 KB)"

Tsotras","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Honeybees are vital for pollination and food production. Among many factors, extreme temperature (e.g., due to climate change) is particularly dangerous for bee health. Anticipating such extremities would allow beekeepers to take early preventive action. Thus, given sensor (temperature) time series data from beehives, how can we find patterns and do forecasting? Forecasting is crucial as it helps spot unexpected behavior and thus issue warnings to the beekeepers. In that case, what are the right models for forecasting? ARIMA, RNNs, or something else? We propose the EBV (Electronic Bee-Veterinarian) method, which has the following desirable properties: (i) principled: it is based on a) diffusion equations from physics and b) control theory for feedback-loop controllers; (ii) effective: it works well on multiple, real-world time sequences, (iii) explainable: it needs only a handful of parameters (e.g., bee strength) that beekeepers can easily understand and trust, and (iv) scalable: it performs linearly in time. We applied our method to multiple real-world time sequences, and found that it yields accurate forecasting (up to 49% improvement in RMSE compared to baselines), and segmentation. Specifically, discontinuities detected by EBV mostly coincide with domain expert's opinions, showcasing our approach's potential and practical feasibility. Moreover, EBV is scalable and fast, taking about 20 minutes on a stock laptop for reconstructing two months of sensor data.","Fri, 2 Feb 2024 21:05:56 UTC (11,258 KB)"

Prior attempts to incorporate health into recipe recommendation and analysis systems have primarily focused on ingredient nutritional components or utilized basic computational models trained on curated labeled data. Enhanced models that capture the inherent relationship between food ingredients and biomedical concepts can be more beneficial for food-related research, given the wealth of information in biomedical texts. Considering the costly data labeling process, these models should effectively utilize both labeled and unlabeled data. This paper introduces Entity Relationship Sentiment Analysis (ERSA), a new task that captures the sentiment of a text based on an entity pair. ERSA extends the widely studied Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task. Specifically, our study concentrates on the ERSA task applied to biomedical texts, focusing on (entity-entity) pairs of biomedical and food concepts. ERSA poses a significant challenge compared to traditional sentiment analysis tasks, as sentence sentiment may not align with entity relationship sentiment.

While conventional analysis of organic pollutants requires expensive equipment, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has demonstrated great potential for accurate detection of these contaminants. However, SERS analytical difficulties, such as spectral preprocessing, denoising, and substrate-based spectral variation, have hindered widespread use of the technique. Here, we demonstrate an approach for predicting the concentration of sample pollutants from messy, unprocessed Raman data using machine learning. Frequency domain transform methods, including the Fourier and Walsh Hadamard transforms, are applied to sets of Raman spectra of three model micropollutants in water (rhodamine 6G, chlorpyrifos, and triclosan), which are then used to train machine learning algorithms. Using standard machine learning models, the concentration of sample pollutants are predicted with more than 80 percent cross-validation accuracy from raw Raman data. cross-validation accuracy of 85 percent was achieved using deep learning for a moderately sized dataset (100 spectra), and 70 to 80 percent cross-validation accuracy was achieved even for very small datasets (50 spectra). Additionally, standard models were shown to accurately identify characteristic peaks via analysis of their importance scores. The approach shown here has the potential to be applied to facilitate accurate detection and analysis of persistent organic pollutants by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 21:49:40 UTC (3,403 KB)"

Silva, Lionel Bovetto, Christophe ","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","In this paper, we quantify weak protein protein interactions in solution using Cross-Interaction Chromatography (CIC) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and demonstrate that they can be modulated by the addition of free amino acids. With CIC, we determined the second osmotic virial cross-interaction coefficient (B23) as a proxy for the interaction strength between two different proteins. We perform SPR experiments to establish the binding affinity between the same proteins. With CIC, we show that the amino acids proline, glutamine, and arginine render the protein cross-interactions more repulsive or equivalently less attractive. Specifically, we measured B23 between lysozyme (Lys) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) and between Lys and protein isolates (whey and canola). We find that B23 increases when amino acids are added to the solution even at millimolar concentrations, corresponding to protein ligand stoichiometric ratios as low as 1 to 1. With SPR, we show that the binding affinity between proteins can change by one order of magnitude when 10 mM of glutamine are added. In the case of Lys and one whey protein isolate it changes from the mM to the M, thus by three orders of magnitude. Interestingly, this efficient modulation of the protein cross-interactions does not alter the protein's secondary structure. The capacity of amino acids to modulate protein cross-interactions at mM concentrations is remarkable and may have an impact across fields in particular for specific applications in the food or pharmaceutical industries.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 16:32:31 UTC (536 KB)"

Over the years, many successful machine learning models for crop mapping have been developed that use just the multi-spectral imagery from satellites to predict crop type over the area of interest. However, these traditional methods do not account for the physical processes that govern crop growth. At a high level, crop growth can be envisioned as physical parameters, such as weather and soil type, acting upon the plant leading to crop growth which can be observed via satellites. In this paper, we propose Weather-based Spatio-Temporal segmentation network with ATTention (WSTATT), a deep learning model that leverages this understanding of crop growth by formulating it as an inverse model that combines weather (Daymet) and satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) to generate accurate crop maps. We show that our approach provides significant improvements over existing algorithms that solely rely on spectral imagery by comparing segmentation maps and F1 classification scores. Furthermore, effective use of attention in WSTATT architecture enables detection of crop types earlier in the season (up to 5 months in advance), which is very useful for improving food supply projections. We finally discuss the impact of weather by correlating our results with crop phenology to show that WSTATT is able to capture physical properties of crop growth.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 04:15:22 UTC (3,206 KB)"

The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors: the well-known Keller--Segel collapse and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports Keller--Segel collapse and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.","Fri, 26 Jan 2024 18:18:51 UTC (6,227 KB)"

The results show that the Danish breweries could save 1.56 % of electricity costs annually while maintaining operational security and reducing approximately 1745 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, medium-size breweries could obtain higher relative benefits by providing energy flexibility, especially those producing lager and ale.

This study provides the first worldwide test of how retail food prices relate to empirically estimated environmental impacts and nutritional profile scores between and within food groups. We use prices for 811 retail food items commonly sold in 181 countries during 2011 and 2017, matched to estimated carbon and water footprints and nutritional profiles, to test whether healthier and more environmentally sustainable foods are more expensive between and within food groups. We find that within almost all groups, less expensive items have significantly lower carbon and water footprints. Associations are strongest for animal source foods, where each 10% lower price is associated with 20 grams lower CO2-equivalent carbon and 5 liters lower water footprint per 100kcal. Gradients between price and nutritional profile vary by food group, price range, and nutritional attribute. In contrast, lower-priced items have lower nutritional value in only some groups over some price ranges, and that relationship is sometimes reversed. These findings reveal opportunities to reduce financial and environmental costs of diets, contributing to transitions towards healthier, more environmentally sustainable food systems.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:34:23 UTC (1,247 KB)"

We show that damage is not caused by the expansion of water upon freezing, or the growth of ice-filled cavities in the hydrogel. Instead, local ice growth dehydrates the surrounding hydrogel, leading to drying-induced fracture. This dehydration is driven by the process of cryosuction, whereby undercooled ice sucks nearby water towards itself, feeding its growth. Our results highlight the strong analogy between freezing damage and desiccation cracking, which we anticipate being useful for developing an understanding of both topics.

Solving this problem requires that, in addition to predicting the minimum temperature, we can provide enough time to implement the necessary measures. Empirical methods have been provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which can predict the minimum temperature, but not in time. In addition to this, we can use machine learning methods to model the minimum temperature. In this study, we have used three methods Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as deep learning methods, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). A customized loss function designed for methods based on deep learning, which can be effective in reducing prediction errors. With methods based on deep learning models, not only do we observe a reduction in RMSE error compared to empirical methods but also have more time to predict minimum temperature. Thus, we can model the minimum temperature for the next 24 hours by having the current 24 hours. With the gradient boosting model (XGBoost) we can keep the prediction time as deep learning and RMSE error reduced.

In order to have a profitable, sustainable, and farmer-friendly agricultural practice, this paper proposes a context-based crop recommendation system powered by a weather forecast model. With extensive evaluation, the multivariate Stacked Bi-LSTM Network is employed as the weather forecasting model. The proposed weather model can forecast Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, and Sunshine for any given location in Bangladesh with higher accuracy. These predictions guide our system to assist the farmers in making feasible decisions about planting, irrigation, harvesting, and so on. Additionally, our full-fledged system is capable of alerting the farmers about extreme weather conditions so that preventive measures can be undertaken to protect the crops. Finally, the system is also adept at making knowledge-based crop suggestions for the flood and drought-prone regions of Bangladesh.","Sun, 21 Jan 2024 06:33:45 UTC (7,480 KB)"

The growth of dynamical heterogeneities, or strong spatial variations in the motion of the particles constituting the system, is a hallmark feature of slow glassy dynamics. We report here a systematic confocal microscopy study that characterizes the cooperative dynamics of fluorescently-labelled colloidal particles in dense aqueous suspensions. We demonstrate that jammed particulate suspensions can be fluidized by increasing the width of the particle size distribution. Our molecular dynamics simulations, performed to numerically investigate the effects of continuous-size polydispersity on dense particle packing dynamics, show an excellent match with our experimental results.

An assumption was made that the inventory is managed under a continuous review policy and the warehouse has limited space. The model seeks to minimize the annual total cost of managing the warehouse. The model will be a nonlinear mixed programming one, which is solved by Pyomo as a leading library in Python language programming. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the use of the model and, through sensitivity analysis, develop insights into the operation of cold warehouses.

Traditional methods for monitoring beehives, such as human inspection, are subjective, disruptive, and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, artificial intelligence has been used to assess beehive health. However, previous studies have lacked an end-to-end solution and primarily relied on data from a single source, either bee images or sounds. This study introduces a comprehensive system consisting of bee object detection and health evaluation. Additionally, it utilized a combination of visual and audio signals to analyze bee behaviors. An Attention-based Multimodal Neural Network (AMNN) was developed to adaptively focus on key features from each type of signal for accurate bee health assessment. The AMNN achieved an overall accuracy of 92.61%, surpassing eight existing single-signal Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. It outperformed the best image-based model by 32.51% and the top sound-based model by 13.98% while maintaining efficient processing times. Furthermore, it improved prediction robustness, attaining an F1-score higher than 90% across all four evaluated health conditions. The study also shows that audio signals are more reliable than images for assessing bee health. By seamlessly integrating AMNN with image and sound data in a comprehensive bee health monitoring system, this approach provides a more efficient and non-invasive solution for the early detection of bee diseases and the preservation of bee colonies.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 14:06:29 UTC (3,865 KB)"

Food supply chain is the process of tracing a crop from the farmer or producer to the buyer. With the advent of blockchain, providing a safe and fraud-free environment for the provision of numerous agricultural necessities has become much easier. Because of the globalization of trade, the present supply chain market today includes various companies involving integration of data, complex transactions and distribution. Information tamper resistance, supply-demand relationships, and traceable oversight are all difficulties that arise as a result of this. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can provide information that is resistant to tampering. This strategy can eliminate the need for a centralized trusted authority, intermediaries, and business histories, allowing for increased production and security while maintaining the highest levels of integrity, liability, and safety. In order to have an integrity and transparency in food supply chain in the agricultural sector, a framework is proposed here based on block chain and IoT.","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 04:16:01 UTC (292 KB)"

Monitoring plants and measuring their traits is an important task in agriculture often referred to as plant phenotyping. Traditionally, this task is done manually, which is time- and labor-intensive. Robots can automate phenotyping providing reproducible and high-frequency measurements. Today's perception systems use deep learning to interpret these measurements, but require a substantial amount of annotated data to work well. Obtaining such labels is challenging as it often requires background knowledge on the side of the labelers. This paper addresses the problem of reducing the labeling effort required to perform leaf instance segmentation on 3D point clouds, which is a first step toward phenotyping in 3D. Separating all leaves allows us to count them and compute relevant traits as their areas, lengths, and widths. We propose a novel self-supervised task-specific pre-training approach to initialize the backbone of a network for leaf instance segmentation. We also introduce a novel automatic postprocessing that considers the difficulty of correctly segmenting the points close to the stem, where all the leaves petiole overlap. The experiments presented in this paper suggest that our approach boosts the performance over all the investigated scenarios. We also evaluate the embeddings to assess the quality of the fully unsupervised approach and see a higher performance of our domain-specific postprocessing.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 08:11:08 UTC (1,419 KB)"

Distance metrics were calculated for these attributes and fed to tree-based classifiers. POI-restaurant matching was conducted separately for Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Experimental estimates demonstrate that a matching POI can be found for over 35% of restaurants in these countries. As part of these estimates, test datasets were manually created, and RandomForest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost perform well, with most accuracy, precision, and recall scores close to or higher than 90% for matched vs. unmatched classification.

Examples include but are not limited to medicine, detection of explosives, and food quality control. Measurements collected with electronic noses can be used for classification and analysis of VOCs. One type of electronic noses that has seen considerable development in recent years is Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS). DMS yields measurements that are visualized as dispersion plots that contain traces, also known as alpha curves. Current methods used for analyzing DMS dispersion plots do not usually utilize the information stored in the continuity of these traces, which suggests that alternative approaches should be investigated. Results: In this work, for the first time, dispersion plots were interpreted as a series of measurements evolving sequentially. Thus, it was hypothesized that time-series classification algorithms can be effective for classification and analysis of dispersion plots. An extensive dataset of 900 dispersion plots for five chemicals measured at five flow rates and two concentrations was collected. The data was used to analyze the classification performance of six algorithms. According to our hypothesis, the highest classification accuracy of 88% was achieved by a Long-Short Term Memory neural network, which supports our hypothesis. Significance: A new concept for approaching classification tasks of dispersion plots is presented and compared with other well-known classification algorithms. This creates a new angle of view for analysis and classification of the dispersion plots. In addition, a new dataset of dispersion plots is openly shared to public.","Sat, 13 Jan 2024 12:56:04 UTC (5,635 KB)"

However, in the context of Africa, practical applications are often hindered by the limited availability of high-resolution cropland maps. Such maps typically require extensive human labeling, thereby creating a scalability bottleneck. To address this, we propose an approach that utilizes unsupervised object clustering to refine existing weak labels, such as those obtained from global cropland maps. The refined labels, in conjunction with sparse human annotations, serve as training data for a semantic segmentation network designed to identify cropland areas. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the benefits of the improved weak labels generated by our method. In a scenario where we train our model with only 33 human-annotated labels, the F_1 score for the cropland category increases from 0.53 to 0.84 when we add the mined negative labels.","Sat, 13 Jan 2024 08:45:41 UTC (33,894 KB)"

These changes involve transformations of comestible resources. For a model to effectively reason about cooking recipes, it must accurately discern and understand the inputs and outputs of intermediate steps within the recipe. Aiming to address this, we present a new corpus of cooking recipes enriched with descriptions of intermediate steps of the recipes that explicate the input and output for each step.

Aiming at the problems of serious spectral confusion in visible high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images of different phases, interference of large complex background and salt-and-pepper noise by existing semantic change detection (SCD) algorithms, in order to effectively extract deep image features of crops and meet the demand of agricultural practical engineering applications, this paper designs and proposes an agricultural geographic scene and parcel-scale constrained SCD framework for crops (AGSPNet). AGSPNet framework contains three parts: agricultural geographic scene (AGS) division module, parcel edge extraction module and crop SCD module. Meanwhile, we produce and introduce an UAV image SCD dataset (CSCD) dedicated to agricultural monitoring, encompassing multiple semantic variation types of crops in complex geographical scene. We conduct comparative experiments and accuracy evaluations in two test areas of this dataset, and the results show that the crop SCD results of AGSPNet consistently outperform other deep learning SCD models in terms of quantity and quality, with the evaluation metrics F1-score, kappa, OA, and mIoU obtaining improvements of 0.038, 0.021, 0.011 and 0.062, respectively, on average over the sub-optimal method.

Existing research on using LLMs to generate recipes has shown that LLMs can be finetuned to generate realistic-sounding recipes. However, on close examination, these generated recipes often fail to meet basic requirements like including chicken as an ingredient in chicken dishes.

Stability predictions from current models of energy flow are often sensitive to details in their formulation, and their complexity makes it difficult to elucidate underlying mechanisms of general phenomena. Here, within the maximum information entropy inference framework (MaxEnt), we derive a simple formula for the energy flow carried by each linkage between two adjacent trophic layers. Inputs to the model are the topological structure of the food web and aggregate energy fluxes entering or exiting each species node. For ecosystems with interactions dominated by consumer-resource interactions between two trophic layers, we construct a model of species dynamics based on the energy flow predictions from the MaxEnt model. Mathematical analyses and simulations of the model show that a food web topology with a higher matrix dipole moment promotes stability against small perturbations in population sizes, where the 	extit{matrix dipole moment} is a simple nestedness metric that we introduce. Since nested bipartite subnetworks arise naturally in food webs, our result provides an explanation for the stability of natural communities.","Tue, 9 Jan 2024 20:48:10 UTC (220 KB)"

However, the resulting responses may suffer from the influence of the intrinsic aspects of the respondent's personality and emotional context at the time of the interview. This study proposes a methodology to generate and select control variables for these latent psychosituational traits, thus mitigating the risk of omitted variable bias. We developed an econometric model of the determinants of passenger satisfaction in a survey conducted at the largest airport in Latin America, São Paulo GRU Airport. Our focus was on the role of flight delays in the perception of quality. The results of this study confirm the existence of a relationship between flight delays and the global satisfaction of passengers with airports. In addition, favorable evaluations regarding airports' food/beverage concessions and Wi-Fi services, but not their retail options, have a relevant moderating effect on that relationship. Furthermore, dissatisfaction arising from passengers' interaction with the airline can have negative spillover effects on their satisfaction with the airport. We also found evidence of blame-attribution behavior, in which only delays of internal origin, such as failures in flight management, are significant, indicating that passengers overlook weather-related flight delays. Finally, the results suggest that an empirical specification that does not consider the latent psychosituational traits of passengers produces a relevant overestimation of the absolute effect of flight delays on passenger satisfaction.","Thu, 4 Jan 2024 08:44:05 UTC (1,883 KB)"

Projections show that additional investments in the supply of agricultural products would modestly accelerate improvements in adequacy where shortfalls are greatest, revealing the need for complementary investments to increase purchasing power and demand for under-consumed food groups especially in low-income countries.","Tue, 2 Jan 2024 07:52:05 UTC (1,394 KB)"

It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate change will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or more significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known as agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of raising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible for it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity. The agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging technologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors, smart farming transforms traditional production methods and international agricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is optimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The agricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the fourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods with cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and efficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the agriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities, and other stakeholders is necessary. This paper covers Agriculture 4.0, looks at its possible benefits and drawbacks of the implementation methodologies, compatibility, reliability, and investigates the several digital tools that are being utilized to change the agriculture industry and how to mitigate the challenges.","Mon, 1 Jan 2024 17:02:49 UTC (1,607 KB)"

This problem arises in different application areas such as automobile, textile, food, and chemical industries. The so-called circle packing problem can be cast as a nonconvex quadratically constrained program, and is difficult to solve in general. An iterative solution approach based on a bisection-type algorithm on the radius of the larger circle is provided. The present algorithm discretizes the container into small cells and solves two different integer linear programming formulations proposed for a restricted and a relaxed version of the original problem. The present algorithm is enhanced with solution space reduction, bound tightening and variable elimination techniques. Then, a computational study is performed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The present algorithm is compared with BARON and Gurobi that solve the original nonlinear formulation and heuristic methods from literature, and obtain promising results.","Sat, 30 Dec 2023 12:47:23 UTC (36 KB)"

Understanding the factors that influence consumer participation in CSA is crucial, yet the complete picture and interrelations of these factors remain unclear in existing studies. This research adopts a scoping review and the KJ method to elucidate the factors influencing consumer participation in CSA and to theorize the consumer participation. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of individual decision-making for participation, under the premise that individuals are embedded in socio-cultural environments. We examine the decision-making process based on the seesaw of expected gains and losses from participation, along with the reflexivity to the individual and the process of updating decision-making post-participation. Our study highlights how individual decision-making for participation is influenced by relationships with others within the embedded socio-cultural environment, as well as by attachment and connection to the community. It also shows that discrepancies between expectations and experiences post-participation, and the transformation of the social capital, promote the updating of decision-making processes. Although there are limitations, the insights gained from this study offer profound implications for stakeholders and provide valuable insights for more sustainable and efficient CSA practices. This research establishes a robust foundation for future studies on CSA.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 09:24:23 UTC (640 KB)"

To facilitate FoodLMM to deal with tasks beyond pure text output, we introduce a series of novel task-specific tokens and heads, enabling the model to predict food nutritional values and multiple segmentation masks. We adopt a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we utilize multiple public food benchmarks for multi-task learning by leveraging instruct-following paradigm. In the second stage, we construct a multi-round conversation and a reasoning segmentation datasets to fine-tune the model, enabling it to conduct professional dialogues and generate segmentation masks based on complex reasoning in food domain.

In a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, engaging in activities such as interacting with in-car menus, consuming food or beverages, or engaging in telephonic conversations while operating a vehicle can be significant sources of driver distraction. From this viewpoint, this paper introduces a novel method for detection of driver distraction using multi-view driver action images. The proposed method is a vision transformer-based framework with pose estimation and action inference, namely PoseViNet. The motivation for adding posture information is to enable the transformer to focus more on key features. As a result, the framework is more adept at identifying critical actions. The proposed framework is compared with various state-of-the-art models using SFD3 dataset representing 10 behaviors of drivers. It is found from the comparison that the PoseViNet outperforms these models. The proposed framework is also evaluated with the SynDD1 dataset representing 16 behaviors of driver. As a result, the PoseViNet achieves 97.55% validation accuracy and 90.92% testing accuracy with the challenging dataset.","Fri, 22 Dec 2023 10:13:10 UTC (1,758 KB)"

To this end, many international organizations have funded training and technology transfer programs that aim to promote productivity and income growth, fight poverty and enhance food security among smallholder farmers in developing countries. Stochastic production frontier analysis can be a useful tool when evaluating the effectiveness of these programs. However, accounting for treatment endogeneity, often intrinsic to these interventions, only recently has received any attention in the stochastic frontier literature. In this work, we extend the classical maximum likelihood estimation of stochastic production frontier models by allowing both the production frontier and inefficiency to depend on a potentially endogenous binary treatment. We use instrumental variables to define an assignment mechanism for the treatment, and we explicitly model the density of the first and second-stage composite error terms. We provide empirical evidence of the importance of controlling for endogeneity in this setting using farm-level data from a soil conservation program in El Salvador.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 15:32:31 UTC (6,150 KB)"

However, prior work showed that exposure to some dashboards, notably Google's My Activity dashboard, results in significant decreases in perceived concern and increases in perceived benefit from data collection, contrary to expectations. We theorize that this result is due to the fact that data dashboards currently do not sufficiently ""connect the dots"" of the data food chain, that is, by connecting data collection with the use of that data. To evaluate this, we designed a study where participants assigned advertising interest labels to their own real activities, effectively acting as a behavioral advertising engine to ""connect the dots."" When comparing pre- and post-labeling task responses, we find no significant difference in concern with Google's data collection practices, which indicates that participants' priors are maintained after more exposure to the data food chain (differing from prior work), suggesting that data dashboards that offer deeper perspectives of how data collection is used have potential. However, these gains are offset when participants are exposed to their true interest labels inferred by Google. Concern for data collection dropped significantly as participants viewed Google's labeling as generic compared to their own more specific labeling. This presents a possible new paradox that must be overcome when designing data dashboards, the generic paradox, which occurs when users misalign individual, generic inferences from collected data as benign compared to the totality and specificity of many generic inferences made about them.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 13:05:09 UTC (998 KB)"

Most households experiencing food insecurity crises are now in fragile states (Townsend et al., 2021), making it difficult to support vulnerable, hard-to-reach populations without interference from oppressive governments and non-state actors (Kurtzer, 2019; Cliffe et al., 2023). Despite growing interest in using digital payments for crisis response (Suri and Jack, 2016; Pazarbasioglu et al., 2020; Aiken et al., 2022), there is limited causal evidence on their efficacy (Gentilini, 2022; WFP, 2023). We show that digital payments can address basic needs during a humanitarian crisis. We conducted a randomized evaluation among very poor, mostly tech-illiterate, female-headed households in Afghanistan with digital transfers of $45 every two weeks for two months. Digital aid led to significant improvements in nutrition and in mental well-being. We find high usage rates, no evidence of diversion by the Taliban despite rigorous checks, and that 80% of recipients would prefer digital aid rather than pay a 2.5% fee to receive aid in cash. Conservative assumptions put the cost of delivery under 7 cents per dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Program's global figure for cash-based humanitarian assistance. These savings could help reduce hunger without additional resources. Asked to predict our findings, policymakers and experts underestimated beneficiaries' ability to use digital transfers and overestimated the likelihood of diversion and the costs of delivery. Such misperceptions might impede the adoption of new technologies during crises. These results highlight the potential for digital aid to complement existing approaches in supporting vulnerable populations during crises.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 21:17:57 UTC (3,439 KB)"

Parshad","Dynamical Systems (math.DS)","The provision of additional food (AF) sources to an introduced predator has been identified as a mechanism to improve pest control. However, AF models with prey dependent functional responses can cause unbounded growth of the predator cite{S27}. To avoid such dynamics, an AF model with mutual interference effect has been proposed cite{S02}. The analysis therein reveals that if the quantity of additional food $xi > h(epsilon)$, where $epsilon$ is the mutual interference parameter, then pest eradication is possible, and this is facilitated via a transcritical bifurcation. We revisit this model and show novel dynamical behaviors. In particular, pest eradication is possible for a tighter range of AF $g(epsilon) < xi < f(epsilon) < h(epsilon)$, and can also occur via a saddle node bifurcation. We observe bi-stability, as well as local bifurcations of Hopf type. We also prove a global bifurcation, of homoclinic type. This bifurcation in turn is shown to create a non-standard dynamic wherein the pest extinction state becomes an ``almost"" global attractor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof of existence of such a dynamical structure in AF models. We discuss our analysis in the context of designing novel bio-control strategies.","Mon, 18 Dec 2023 22:04:58 UTC (5,373 KB)"

This paper investigates the permeability of Twittersphere, the total universe of Twitter users and their habits, towards relevant events in the financial market. Analysis shows that a general purpose social media is permeable to financial-specific events and establishes Twitter as a relevant feeder for taking decisions regarding the financial market and event fraudulent activities in that market. However, the provenance of contributions, their different levels of credibility and quality and even the purpose or intention behind them should to be considered and carefully contemplated if Twitter is used as a single source for decision taking. With the overall aim of this research, to deploy an architecture for real-time monitoring of irregularities in the financial market, this paper conducts a series of experiments on the level of permeability and the permeable features of Twitter in the event of one of these irregularities. To be precise, Twitter data is collected concerning an event comprising of a specific financial action on the 27th January 2017:{~ }the announcement about the merge of two companies Tesco PLC and Booker Group PLC, listed in the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), to create the UK's Leading Food Business.

The experimental results confirm that a far-impacting financial event, such as the merger considered, caused apparent disturbances in all the features considered, that is, information volume, content and sentiment as well as geographical provenance.

The k-FOOD problem offers the versatility to model a variety of real-world use cases such as food delivery, ride sharing, and quick commerce. Moreover, motivated by the need for fairness in online platforms, we introduce the FAIR k-FOOD problem with the max-min objective.

Given the importance of agriculture in Tigray to livelihoods and food security, determining the impact of the war on cultivated area is critical, but quantifying this impact was difficult due to restricted movement within and into the region due to conflict-driven insecurity and blockages. Using satellite imagery and statistical area estimation techniques, we assessed changes in crop cultivation area in Tigray before and during the war. Our findings show that cultivated area was largely stable between 2020-2021 despite the widespread impacts of the war. We estimated 1,132,000 +/- 133,000 hectares of cultivation in pre-war 2020 compared to 1,217,000 +/- 132,000 hectares in mid-war 2021.

Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (i.e. the ""seesaw phenomenon""). In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly. Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction. We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency.","Sun, 17 Dec 2023 15:28:06 UTC (1,427 KB)[v2] Wed, 20 Dec 2023 16:11:14 UTC (1,427 KB)[v3] Fri, 23 Fe"

Capillary suspensions are encountered in a wide array of applications including 3D printing, porous materials, and food formulations, but despite recent progress, the micromechanics of particle clusters in flow is not fully understood. In this work, we study the dynamics of meniscus-bound particle clusters in planar extensional flow using a Stokes trap, which is an automated flow control technique that allows for precise manipulation of freely suspended particles or particle clusters in flow. Focusing on the case of a two-particle doublet, we use a combination of experiments and analytical modeling to understand how particle clusters rearrange, deform, and ultimately break up in extensional flow. The time required for cluster breakup is quantified as a function of capillary number $Ca$ and meniscus volume $V$. Importantly, a critical capillary number $Ca_{crit}$ for cluster breakup is determined using a combination of experiments and modeling. Cluster relaxation experiments are also performed by deforming particle clusters in flow, followed by flow cessation prior to breakup and observing cluster relaxation dynamics under zero-flow conditions. In all cases, experiments are complemented by an analytical model that accounts for capillary forces, lubrication forces, hydrodynamic drag forces, and hydrodynamic interactions acting on the particles. Results from the analytical models are found to be in good agreement with experiments. Overall, this work provides a new quantitative understanding of the deformation dynamics of capillary clusters in extensional flow.","Sat, 16 Dec 2023 23:42:53 UTC (2,177 KB)"

In many of these environments, microorganisms coexist with settling particles. Here, we investigate the effects of microbial activity (swimming 	extit{E. coli}) on the settling dynamics of passive colloidal particles using particle tracking methods. Our results reveal the existence of two distinct regimes in the correlation length scale ($L_u$) and the effective diffusivity of the colloidal particles ($D_{e!f!f}$), with increasing bacterial concentration ($phi_b$). At low $phi_b$, the parameters $L_u$ and $D_{e!f!f}$ monotonically increases with increasing $phi_b$. Beyond a critical $phi_b$, second regime is found in which both $D_{e!f!f}$ and $L_u$ are independent of $phi_b$.

Ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of milk quality assessment is vital for maintaining the quality of dairy farm produce. Milk spectral data, Mid-infrared spectra (MIRS) of milk samples, are frequently employed for milk quality evaluations, encompassing various milk quality parameters. However, conventional milk quality analyses have overlooked the scaling nature, known as stochastic similarity in different scales, inherent in milk spectral data. Wavelet transforms are among the tools used in these analyses, although they are primarily used as data pre-processing techniques without fully realizing their potential in extracting valuable insights. The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the importance of accounting for scaling properties in assessing milk quality. A set of 12 descriptors is computed to characterize scaling properties in milk spectral data within the wavelet domain. These descriptors are then assessed for their effectiveness in milk quality assessments utilizing 18 different milk quality parameters. They notably demonstrated comparable performance to existing methods while utilizing fewer features when applied to an MIRS dataset. This innovative approach holds substantial promise for advancing the field of milk quality assessment, offering a means to achieve more accurate and efficient evaluations while shedding light on previously unexplored aspects of milk spectral data.","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 21:04:10 UTC (951 KB)"

Lo, Jianing Qiu, Zeyu Wang, Junhong Chen, Bo Xiao, Wu Yuan, Stamatia Giannarou, Gary Fro","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Conventional approaches to dietary assessment are primarily grounded in self-reporting methods or structured interviews conducted under the supervision of dietitians. These methods, however, are often subjective, potentially inaccurate, and time-intensive. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions have been devised to automate the dietary assessment process, these prior AI methodologies encounter challenges in their ability to generalize across a diverse range of food types, dietary behaviors, and cultural contexts. This results in AI applications in the dietary field that possess a narrow specialization and limited accuracy. Recently, the emergence of multimodal foundation models such as GPT-4V powering the latest ChatGPT has exhibited transformative potential across a wide range of tasks (e.g., Scene understanding and image captioning) in numerous research domains. These models have demonstrated remarkable generalist intelligence and accuracy, capable of processing various data modalities. In this study, we explore the application of multimodal ChatGPT within the realm of dietary assessment. Our findings reveal that GPT-4V excels in food detection under challenging conditions with accuracy up to 87.5% without any fine-tuning or adaptation using food-specific datasets. By guiding the model with specific language prompts (e.g., African cuisine), it shifts from recognizing common staples like rice and bread to accurately identifying regional dishes like banku and ugali. Another GPT-4V's standout feature is its contextual awareness. GPT-4V can leverage surrounding objects as scale references to deduce the portion sizes of food items, further enhancing its accuracy in translating food weight into nutritional content. This alignment with the USDA National Nutrient Database underscores GPT-4V's potential to advance nutritional science and dietary assessment techniques.","Thu, 14 Dec 2023 01:26:45 UTC (20,749 KB)"

One of the most important imperatives in this path is the availability of quality data to feed all the process in digital transformation. But the quality of data is not so obvious if we consider the variety of products and suppliers in the grocery market. Within this context of digital transformation of grocery industry, 	extit{Midiadia} is Spanish data provider company that works on converting data from the retailers' products into knowledge with attributes and insights from the product labels, that is, maintaining quality data in a dynamic market with a high dispersion of products. Currently, they manually categorize products (groceries) according to the information extracted directly (text processing) from the product labelling and packaging. This paper introduces a solution to automatically categorize the constantly changing product catalogue into a 3-level food taxonomy. Our proposal studies three different approaches: a score-based ranking method, traditional machine learning algorithms, and deep neural networks. Thus, we provide four different classifiers that support a more efficient and less error-prone maintenance of groceries catalogues, the main asset of the company. Finally, we have compared the performance of these three alternatives, concluding that traditional machine learning algorithms perform better, but closely followed by the score-based approach.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 18:11:15 UTC (2,022 KB)"

Some resulting stressors are more direct like fisheries, others more indirect like ocean acidification, yet they jointly affect marine biota, communities and entire ecosystems. While single-stressor effects have been widely investigated, the interactive effects of multiple stressors on ecosystems are less researched. In this study, we review the literature on multiple stressors and their interactive effects in coastal environments across organisms. We classify the interactions into three categories: synergistic, additive, and antagonistic. We found phytoplankton and mollusks to be the most studied taxonomic groups. The stressor combinations of climate warming, ocean acidification, eutrophication, and metal pollution are the most critical for coastal ecosystems as they exacerbate adverse effects on physiological traits such as growth rate, basal respiration, and size. Phytoplankton appears to be most sensitive to interactions between metal and nutrient pollution. In nutrient-enriched environments, the presence of metals considerably affects the uptake of nutrients, and increases respiration costs and toxin production in phytoplankton. For mollusks, warming and low pH are the most lethal stressors. The combined effect of heat stress and ocean acidification leads to decreased growth rate, shell size, and acid-base regulation capacity in mollusks. However, for a holistic understanding of how coastal food webs will evolve with ongoing changes, we suggest more research on ecosystem-level responses. This can be achieved by combining in-situ observations from controlled environments (e.g. mesocosm experiments) with modelling approaches.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 14:25:26 UTC (1,680 KB)"

However, this broad objective is not practical for an agent that works on a specific task. Not all rejected samples will be used for learning continually in the future. Some novel images in the open environment may not belong to the domain of interest. Hence, identifying the unknown in the domain of interest is essential for a machine learning model to learn merely the important samples. In this study, we propose an evaluation protocol for estimating a model's capability in separating unknown in-domain (ID) and unknown out-of-domain (OOD). We evaluated using three approaches with an unknown domain and demonstrated the possibility of identifying the domain of interest using the pre-trained parameters through traditional transfer learning, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), and Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifier with First Integer Neighbor Clustering Hierarchy (FINCH). We experimented with five different domains: garbage, food, dogs, plants, and birds. The results show that all approaches can be used as an initial baseline yielding a good accuracy. In addition, a Balanced Accuracy (BACCU) score from a pre-trained model indicates a tendency to excel in one or more domains of interest. We observed that MobileNetV3 yielded the highest BACCU score for the garbage domain and surpassed complex models such as the transformer network. Meanwhile, our results also suggest that a strong representation in the pre-trained model is important for identifying unknown classes in the same domain.

We introduce adapter layers to consolidate pre-trained CLIP model with much less computation cost than fully cumbersome fine-tuning all the parameters. Furthermore, leveraging on the strong capability of foundation models (i.e., SAM and LLM), we propose to augment recipe and food image by extracting information related to the counterpart. SAM generates image segments corresponding to ingredients in the recipe, while LLM produces a visual imagination description from the recipe, aiming to capture the visual cues of a food image. In addition, we introduce circle loss to regulate cross-modal embedding space, which assigns different penalties for positive and negative pairs. With the extra augmented data from recipe and image, multi-level circle loss is proposed, which applies circle loss not only to original image-recipe pairs, but also to image segments and recipe, visual imagination description and food image as well as any two sections within a recipe. On Recipe1M dataset, our proposed CAR outperforms all the existing methods by a large margin. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of each component of CAR.

Unlike paid labor, non-profit organizations have less control over unpaid volunteers' schedules, efforts, and reliability. However, these organizations can invest in volunteer engagement activities to ensure a steady and adequate supply of volunteer labor. We study a key operational question of how a non-profit organization can manage its volunteer workforce capacity to ensure consistent provision of services. In particular, we formulate a multiclass queueing network model to characterize the optimal engagement activities for the non-profit organization to minimize the costs of enhancing volunteer engagement, while maximizing productive work done by volunteers. Because this problem appears intractable, we formulate an approximating Brownian control problem in the heavy traffic limit and study the dynamic control of that system. Our solution is a nested threshold policy with explicit congestion thresholds that indicate when the non-profit should optimally pursue various types of volunteer engagement activities. A numerical example calibrated using data from a large food bank shows that our dynamic policy for deploying engagement activities can significantly reduce the food bank's total annual cost of its volunteer operations while still maintaining almost the same level of social impact. This improvement in performance does not require any additional resources - it only requires that the food bank strategically deploy its engagement activities based on the number of volunteers signed up to work volunteer shifts.","Tue, 5 Dec 2023 17:50:07 UTC (2,521 KB)[v2] Thu, 7 Dec 2023 06:25:27 UTC (2,521 KB)"

In general, it aimed to provide robots 13 and machines with adaptive locomotion (Ansari et al., 2015), safe and adaptive manipulation 14 (Arleo et al., 2020) and versatile grasping (Langowski et al., 2020). But in agriculture, soft 15 robots have been mainly used in harvesting tasks and more specifically in grasping. In this 16 chapter, we review a candidate group of soft grippers that were used for handling and 17 harvesting crops regarding agricultural challenges i.e. safety in handling and adaptability to 18 the high variation of crops. The review is aimed to show why and to what extent soft grippers 19 have been successful in handling agricultural tasks. The analysis carried out on the results 20 provides future directions for the systematic design of soft robots in agricultural tasks.","Thu, 30 Nov 2023 20:16:48 UTC (3,177 KB)"

Deshpande, Alison B. Dunca","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","Dispersal is a well recognized driver of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and simultaneously an evolving trait. Dispersal evolution has traditionally been studied in single-species metapopulations so that it remains unclear how dispersal evolves in spatially structured communities and food webs. Since most natural systems are biodiverse and spatially structured, and thus affected by dispersal and its evolution, this knowledge gap should be bridged. Here we discuss whether knowledge established in single-species systems holds in spatially structured multispecies systems and highlight generally valid and fundamental principles. Most biotic interactions form the ecological theatre for the evolutionary dispersal play because interactions mediate patterns of fitness expectations in space and time. While this allows for a simple transposition of certain known drivers to a multispecies context, other drivers may require more complex transpositions, or might not be transferred. We discuss an important quantitative modulator of dispersal evolution in the increased trait dimensionality of biodiverse meta-systems and an additional driver in co-dispersal. We speculate that scale and selection pressure mismatches due to co-dispersal, together with increased trait dimensionality may lead to slower and more ""diffuse"" evolution in biodiverse meta-systems. Open questions and potential consequences in both ecological and evolutionary terms call for more investigation.","Thu, 30 Nov 2023 19:57:01 UTC (29 KB)"

However, it remains an open question which characteristics of honey are the most significant for consumers and, more importantly, from an economic point of view, for which of them consumers are willing to pay. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of sensory characteristics in assessing consumers' willingness to pay for honey and to determine which properties and characteristics ""natural"" honey should have to encourage repeated purchases by target consumers. The study involved a behavioral experiment that included a pre-test questionnaire, blind tasting of honey samples, an in-room test to assess perceived quality, and a closed auction using the Becker-DeGroote-Marschak method. As the result, it was revealed that the correspondence of the expected sensations to the actual taste, taste intensity, duration of the aftertaste and the sensations of tickling in the throat had a positive effect on both the perceived quality of the product and the willingness to pay for it, while perception of off-flavors or added sugar had a negative impact. Using factor analysis, we have combined 21 sensory characteristics of honey into eight components that were sufficient to obtain the flavor portrait of honey by Russian consumers.","Thu, 30 Nov 2023 06:12:38 UTC (607 KB)"

The aim of this study was to discover and identify urinary BFIs for onion. Methods and results: In a randomized controlled cross-over trial, 6 overweight participants (age 24-62 years) consumed meals with 20 g/d onion powder or no onion for 2 weeks. Untargeted UPLC-qTOF-MS metabolic profiling analysis was performed on urine samples and the profiles were analysed by multilevel-PLSDA, modified PLS, and nearest shrunken centroid to select features associated with onion intake. Eight biomarkers were tentatively identified; six of them originated from S-substituted cysteine derivatives such as isoalliin and propiin, which are considered the most specific for onion intake. Most of the biomarkers were completely excreted within 24 hours and no accumulation was observed during 2 weeks indicating their ability to reflect only recent intake of onions. Receiver-operator curves were made to evaluate the performance of individual biomarkers for predicting onion intake. The area under the curve values for these biomarkers ranged from 0.81 to 1. Conclusion: Promising biomarkers of recent onion intake have been identified in human urine. Further studies with complex diets are needed to validate the robustness of these biomarkers.","Tue, 28 Nov 2023 19:55:01 UTC (839 KB)"

However, this is a challenge due the presence of occlusions. Multi-view perception approaches allow robots to overcome occlusions, but a tracking component is needed to associate the objects detected by the robot over multiple viewpoints. Most multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are designed for high frame rate sequences and struggle with the occlusions generated by robots' motions and 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce MOT-DETR, a novel approach to detect and track objects in 3D over time using a combination of convolutional networks and transformers. Our method processes 2D and 3D data, and employs a transformer architecture to perform data fusion. We show that MOT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art multi-object tracking methods. Furthermore, we prove that MOT-DETR can leverage 3D data to deal with long-term occlusions and large frame-to-frame distances better than state-of-the-art methods.

To tackle the growing challenges in feeding the planet, cutting-edge management strategies, such as precision agriculture, empower farmers and decision-makers with rich and actionable information to increase the efficiency and sustainability of their farming practices. Crop-type maps are key information for decision-support tools but are challenging and costly to generate. We investigate the capabilities of Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for crop-map prediction task, acknowledging its recent successes at zero-shot image segmentation. However, SAM being limited to up-to 3 channel inputs and its zero-shot usage being class-agnostic in nature pose unique challenges in using it directly for crop-type mapping. We propose using clustering consensus metrics to assess SAM's zero-shot performance in segmenting satellite imagery and producing crop-type maps. Although direct crop-type mapping is challenging using SAM in zero-shot setting, experiments reveal SAM's potential for swiftly and accurately outlining fields in satellite images, serving as a foundation for subsequent crop classification.

Traditional artificial sensory evaluation has poor repeatability, and the machine olfaction represented by the electronic nose (E-nose) is difficult to reflect human feelings. Olfactory electroencephalogram (EEG) contains odor and individual features associated with human olfactory preference, which has unique advantages in odor sensory evaluation. However, the difficulty of cross-subject olfactory EEG recognition greatly limits its application. It is worth noting that E-nose and olfactory EEG are more advantageous in representing odor information and individual emotions, respectively. In this paper, an E-nose and olfactory EEG multimodal learning method is proposed for cross-subject olfactory preference recognition. Firstly, the olfactory EEG and E-nose multimodal data acquisition and preprocessing paradigms are established. Secondly, a complementary multimodal data mining strategy is proposed to effectively mine the common features of multimodal data representing odor information and the individual features in olfactory EEG representing individual emotional information. Finally, the cross-subject olfactory preference recognition is achieved in 24 subjects by fusing the extracted common and individual features, and the recognition effect is superior to the state-of-the-art recognition methods. Furthermore, the advantages of the proposed method in cross-subject olfactory preference recognition indicate its potential for practical odor evaluation applications.","Fri, 24 Nov 2023 11:59:11 UTC (21,517 KB)"

However, it is essential to assess the current water management practices associated with hydropower plant management software. A key concern is the potential conflict between electricity generation and agricultural water needs. Prioritising water for electricity generation can reduce irrigation availability in agriculture during crucial periods like droughts, impacting crop yields and regional food security. Coordination between electricity and agricultural water allocation is necessary to ensure optimal and environmentally sound practices. Neural networks have become valuable tools for hydropower plant management, but their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency in decision making. Additionally, current approaches often do not take advantage of their potential to create a system that effectively balances water allocation. This work is a call for attention and highlights the potential risks of deploying neural network-based hydropower plant management software without proper scrutiny and control. To address these concerns, we propose the adoption of the Agriculture Conscious Hydropower Plant Management framework, aiming to maximise electricity production while prioritising stable irrigation for agriculture. We also advocate reevaluating government-imposed minimum water guidelines for irrigation to ensure flexibility and effective water allocation. Additionally, we suggest a set of regulatory measures to promote model transparency and robustness, certifying software that makes conscious and intelligent water allocation decisions, ultimately safeguarding agriculture from undue strain during droughts.","Wed, 22 Nov 2023 10:22:59 UTC (358 KB)"

It sought to understand the effects of economic challenges on women's dietary choices and access to nutritious food across different socioeconomic groups. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research combined quantitative data from health and economic records with qualitative insights from interviews with diverse women. The study analyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the pandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic difficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the economic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in low-income and marginalized groups. These women reported decreased access to healthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to budget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was less evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The pandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most vulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support and public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic's economic repercussions have indirectly impaired women's nutritional health, especially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged.

In our experiment, participants placed bids for sugar-containing and analogous sugar-free products in a Becker-deGroot-Marschak auction to determine the willingness to pay. Additionally, they rated each product on the level of perceived healthiness, sweetness, tastiness and familiarity with the product. We then used structural equation modelling to estimate the direct, indirect and total effect of the label on the willingness to pay. The results suggest that sugar-free labels significantly increase the willingness to pay due to the perception of sugar-free products as healthier than sugar-containing ones. However, this positive effect is overridden by a significant decrease in perceived sweetness (and hence, tastiness) of products labelled as sugar-free compared to sugar-containing products. As in our sample, healthiness and tastiness are positively related, while healthiness and sweetness are related negatively, these results suggest that it is health-sweetness rather than health-tastiness tradeoff that decreases the efficiency of the sugar-free labelling in nudging consumers towards healthier options.","Thu, 16 Nov 2023 13:26:37 UTC (535 KB)"

The sensor can be installed on the exterior wall of dielectric containers and customized according to the material of the container to enable wireless sensing. Its operation within the lower microwave frequency range (670-730 MHz) serves to minimize signal attenuation in water and streamlines circuitry design. The most significant feature of this sensor is its unique design, rendering it impervious to its surrounding environment. This not only shields it from environmental noise but also maximizes its sensitivity by efficiently utilizing incoming power for sensing purposes. The sensor exhibits remarkable sensitivity, capable of detecting solute concentrations as low as 0.003125 M in water. It can also detect the insertion of foreign solid objects into the container from the exterior wirelessly and distinguish them from liquids being added. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the sensor in this study was optimized for a porcelain wall of 10-12 mm thickness. The sensor's small size and the materials used for its fabrication make it adaptable to a wide range of applications in industries such as food, pharmaceuticals, and bathroom fixtures.

To alleviate this, we propose including some of a user's preferences and instructions in natural language -- collectively termed standing instructions -- as additional context for such interfaces. For example, when a user states I'm hungry, their previously expressed preference for Persian food will be automatically added to the LLM prompt, so as to influence the search for relevant restaurants. We develop NLSI, a language-to-program dataset consisting of over 2.4K dialogues spanning 17 domains, where each dialogue is paired with a user profile (a set of users specific standing instructions) and corresponding structured representations (API calls). A key challenge in NLSI is to identify which subset of the standing instructions is applicable to a given dialogue.

The nematode C. elegans modulates its navigation behavior depending on the association of odor butanone with food (appetitive training) or starvation (aversive training), and will then climb up the butanone gradient or ignore it, respectively. However, the exact change in navigation strategy in response to learning is still unknown. Here we study the learned odor navigation in worms by combining precise experimental measurement and a novel descriptive model of navigation. Our model consists of two known navigation strategies in worms: biased random walk and weathervaning. We infer weights on these strategies by applying the model to worm navigation trajectories and the exact odor concentration it experiences. Compared to naive worms, appetitive trained worms up-regulate the biased random walk strategy, and aversive trained worms down-regulate the weathervaning strategy. The statistical model provides prediction with $>90 %$ accuracy of the past training condition given navigation data, which outperforms the classical chemotaxis metric. We find that the behavioral variability is altered by learning, such that worms are less variable after training compared to naive ones. The model further predicts the learning-dependent response and variability under optogenetic perturbation of the olfactory neuron AWC$^mathrm{ON}$. Lastly, we investigate neural circuits downstream from AWC$^mathrm{ON}$ that are differentially recruited for learned odor-guided navigation. Together, we provide a new paradigm to quantify flexible navigation algorithms and pinpoint the underlying neural substrates.","Mon, 13 Nov 2023 07:21:22 UTC (16,353 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Feb 2024 05:42:33 UTC (21,690 KB)"

Ozone, a chemical with high sterilizing power, is known as a natural substance that is reduced to oxygen and water after reacting with pollutants. Ozone water, which is generated by dissolving ozone in water, has been used in various industrial sectors such as medical care, food, and environment. Due to the unstable molecular state of ozone, however, it is difficult to produce, use, and supply ozone at industrial sites in a stable manner. This study proposed a method for constructing a system that can generate high-concentration ozone water in large quantities using low power in real time and maintaining the concentration of the generated ozone water over the long term. Friction tubes (called 'nanotube') played a key role to generate nanobubble ozone water with an increased half-life for virus killing activity. In addition, the safety of ozone water during its spray into the air was explained, and virucidal activity test cases for the influenza A (H1N1/A/PR8) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus using high-concentration ozone water as well as its technical efficacy were described.","Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:11:18 UTC (818 KB)"

Rossi, Sean P. Cox. Hugues P. Benoît","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL) declined to low abundance in the early 1990s and have since failed to recover due to high natural mortality, which has been linked to grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) predation. Increased grey seal harvests have been suggested to improve cod survival, however, predicting the response of cod to seal abundance changes in the sGSL is complicated by a hypothesized triangular food web involving seals, cod, and small pelagic fishes, wherein the pelagic fishes are prey for cod and grey seals, but may also prey on young cod. Grey seals may therefore have an indirect positive effect on prerecruit cod survival via predation on pelagic fish. Using a multispecies model of intermediate complexity fitted to various scientific and fisheries data, we found that seal predation accounted for the majority of recent cod mortality and that cod will likely be extirpated without a strong and rapid reduction in grey seal abundance. We did not find evidence that reducing grey seal abundance will result in large increases to herring biomass that could impair cod recovery.","Sat, 11 Nov 2023 09:46:36 UTC (10,471 KB)"

Baeza, Matteo Peyla, Lionel Porcar, Carlos Fernández-de-Alba, Sébastien","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","The present work offers a comprehensive description of the acid-induced gelation of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a water-soluble derivative of cellulose broadly used in numerous applications ranging from food packaging to biomedical engineering. Linear viscoelastic properties measured at various pH and CMC contents allow us to build a sol-gel phase diagram, and show that CMC gels exhibit broad power-law viscoelastic spectra that can be rescaled onto a master curve following a time-composition superposition principle. These results demonstrate the microstructural self-similarity of CMC gels, and inspire a mean-field model based on hydrophobic inter-chain association that accounts for the sol-gel boundary over the entire range of CMC content under study. Neutron scattering experiments further confirm this picture and suggest that CMC gels comprise a fibrous network crosslinked by aggregates. Finally, low-field NMR measurements offer an original signature of acid-induced gelation from the solvent perspective. Altogether, these results open avenues for precise manipulation and control of CMC-based hydrogels.","Fri, 10 Nov 2023 22:02:02 UTC (744 KB)[v2] Wed, 24 Jan 2024 14:30:07 UTC (998 KB)"

However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies investigating digital food content's influence on individuals with eating disorders. We conducted two rounds of studies (N=23 and 22, respectively) with individuals with binge eating disorder (BED) or bulimia nervosa (BN) to understand their motivations and practices of consuming digital food content. Our study reveals that individuals with BED and BN anticipate positive effects from food media to overcome their condition, but in practice, it often exacerbates their disorder. We also discovered that many individuals have experienced a cycle of quitting and returning to digital food content consumption. Based on these findings, we articulate design implications for digital food content and multimedia platforms to support vulnerable individuals in everyday online platform interactions.","Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:09:42 UTC (4,642 KB)[v2] Tue, 16 Jan 2024 06:33:46 UTC (9,813 KB)"

Currently, there are no established guidelines for the safe application of ultrasonic neuromodulation in humans beyond those used for diagnostic ultrasound. Therefore, in a series of meetings, the International Consortium for Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) has established expert consensus on considerations for the biophysical safety of TUS. As with diagnostic ultrasound, there are two main biophysical risks associated with the application of TUS: mechanical and thermal bioeffects. Mechanical bioeffects mainly concern the risk of acoustic cavitation, which can lead to local tissue damage such as cell death or blood vessel hemorrhage. Thermal bioeffects may occur when mechanical energy is converted into thermal energy through absorption, leading to tissue heating and potential thermal damage. The ITRUSST safety group has established recommendations based on existing guidelines for diagnostic ultrasound from regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the British Medical Ultrasound Society (BMUS) and the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM). Here, we review existing regulatory guidelines for biomedical ultrasound and consider their relevance for TUS. We then present a concise but comprehensive set of parameters and levels that we consider to be biophysically safe, as summarized in Table 1. While the limit of safety may be higher than these stated levels, the purpose of this paper is to state that this group considers these levels to be safe for transcranial ultrasound stimulation.","Thu, 9 Nov 2023 13:37:27 UTC (447 KB)"

However, the lack of interpretability due to their ``black-box'' nature poses challenges for responsible implementation. Although previous studies have attempted to improve interpretability by using, e.g., attention weights in self-attention layers, these weights often lack clarity, readability, and intuitiveness. In this research, we propose a novel approach to interpreting PLMs by employing high-level, meaningful concepts that are easily understandable for humans. For example, we learn the concept of ``Food'' and investigate how it influences the prediction of a model's sentiment towards a restaurant review. We introduce C$^3$M, which combines human-annotated and machine-generated concepts to extract hidden neurons designed to encapsulate semantically meaningful and task-specific concepts. Through empirical evaluations on real-world datasets, we manifest that our approach offers valuable insights to interpret PLM behavior, helps diagnose model failures, and enhances model robustness amidst noisy concept labels.","Wed, 8 Nov 2023 20:41:18 UTC (9,269 KB)"
